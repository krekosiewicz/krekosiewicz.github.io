        <p>## Philosophy</p>
        <p>This website was implemented using primitive, imperfect, and unfinished solutions. The music you find here has exactly the titles I gave them when they were 'temporarily' saved; the music itself is often false, poorly tuned, with poorly executed mixes. The experience you will find here pertains to my entire professional life, including the "non-professional" part, which may be of little interest from a professional standpoint.</p>
        <p>In short: this website shows what I usually try to hide.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:32px"><span style="color:#E35A00">Perfectionism is a source of suffering.</span> Perfectionism is a block to creativity and a killer of great ideas. Through this website, I confront perfectionism and my own sense of discomfort.</p>
        <p>And at the same time, I have a lot of fun with it. :)</p>
