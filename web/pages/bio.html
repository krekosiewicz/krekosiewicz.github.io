<p>Self-taught Web Developer. With 4 years of experience. Starting a professional career as a full stack developer gives me a strong foundation of web app mechanics from hosting through the backend and database to crafting user experience with React. </p>

<p>    Now, I am focused on the UI/UX aspects of the applications and websites. Under my belt, I have tools like Figma, Astro.js, React.js, headless CMSes, and Cloud Services. This STACK lets me ship the full product to the customer.</p>
