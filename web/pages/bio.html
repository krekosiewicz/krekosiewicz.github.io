    <p>## About Me</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom:32px;">I’ve developed my expertise in software engineering across diverse environments, focusing on design and improving user experience. My professional path includes roles at companies like Nokia, Teleste, Silobreaker where I enhanced my abilities in technologies such as Angular, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Mongodb, and Docker, with a particular focus on front-end architecture. (But I don't mind fullstacking or devopsing from time to time, even though it's not my strenght!). I’ve also embraced freelancing, tackling a variety of projects that span across different industries. This experience has been particularly rewarding, giving me the flexibility to dive deep into technologies and shows me wide aspects of delivering efficient but quick projects </p>

    <p>## Interests</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom:32px;">When I’m not programming, I'm producing music, playing chess (with enthusiasm, but not skill), and brewing more coffee than one person should drink. I also enjoy relaxing in the sauna and spending time with my two cats.</p>

    <p>## What's new</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom:32px;">Currently, I’m excited to be exploring the Astro, learning about the potential of LLMs, and continuing SEO studies</p>
